# TechEmbed React Frontend

This `frontend` folder is a Vite + React scaffold converted from the original Flask templates.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The original Flask `static/css/style.css` has been copied (trimmed) into `src/index.css`.
- Move or copy any images from the root `static/images` into `frontend/public` if you want them served by the frontend build.
